        <h1> Hello, and welcome to my website! </h1>
        <p> This is where I'll be hosting my projects, links to my other websites and online aliases. It'll primarily function, however, as a porfolio or resume site, as well as a playground for expermenting
            with frontend development. My other <a href="https://goodtimesnotebook.netlify.app/">website</a> is a customized <a href="https://exocore.netlify.app/">exocore</a> instance, where I'll be hosting
            my notes on whatever topics take my fancy for the forseeable future. </p>

        <p> My hope is that overtime, with the passage of time, these two websites allow me to track my development as a developer and person. They will also serve as learning examples for
            others, so that they may learn from my mistakes. </p>
