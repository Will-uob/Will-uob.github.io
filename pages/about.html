        <h1 class="norbox"> About me </h1>
        <div class="norbox">
        <p> I'm a 3rd year maths and computer science student at the University of Birmingham. My interests lie primarily within three sub-areas of computer science:
            <ul>
                <li> Machine learning and artifical intelligence, especially deep learning</li>
                <li> Theoretical computer science</li>
                <li> Graphics and game development</li>
            </ul>
            My hope at the moment is to get a 1st at university, and to gain experience in the industry, most likely though a year in industry.
        </p>
        <p> Outside of my formal studies and obligations, I'm very interested in the Japanese language, and also have a fondness for slavic languages, especially Czech, my heritage language.
            My hope is that once I am experienced enough, I can move to Japan and experience life there, working on improving my language and programming abilities. I also enjoy working out,
            especially with calisthenics, and enjoy reading literature and analysis thereof.</p>
