        <h1> About me </h1>
        <p> I'm a 3rd year maths and computer science student at the University of Birmingham. My interests lie primarily within three sub-areas of computer science:
            <ul>
                <li> Machine learning and artifical intelligence, especially deep learning</li>
                <li> Theoretical computer science</li>
                <li> Graphics and game development</li>
            </ul>
            My interest in, and motivation for studying, computer science dwindled during my first and second years at university, but now I'm eager to study, as well
            as find a place in the industry.
